/databases are fast using indexing concept as _index in book

/analysis data using python

/t -test ?

/null hypothesis--alternate hypothesis

/fertiliserr example...
	/null-(height is not function of fertilise used)
	/alternate -(height is function of fertilise used)
	/U want alternate hypothesis to be true here 
	/mean_**Standard deviation conceps and usage said here

/bucket example
	/b1 has good customers..b2 has bad customers
	/so there is actual data of b1_b2 ...and predicted data of b1_b2
 	/null-(no diference in actual and predicted model)
	/alternate -(predicted data will be different from actual)
	/ U want null to be true here

/milk example
	/company says paking more than 1 Ltr
	/customer says packets are less than 1 Ltr
	/shop floor manager(SFM) feels milk is exactly packed
	/from SFM point of view 
		/null-	 mean=1
		/alternate -mean!=1
/motor bike company example
	/company says mileage is >125
	/competitor point of view 
		/null - mean=125
		/alternate- mean <125


//what i get from above example is..
	/null is always lazy ..and says everything fine
	/and alternate is which accepts the flaws/changes

/credit loan example
	/NPA-Non Paying Assets
	/banks giving loans based on Score card recently instead of manual officer validation
	/it is stated that score cards helped reduce NPA by more than 0.25
		/null is new-old_NPA <= 0.25
		/alternate is new-old_NPA >0.25


/from above last 3 examples 
	/alter hyp has been like...
		mean !=
		mean <
		mean >
	/so u can call them as rejection area of null hypothesi....correspondiingly
		
?all time null hypo go with mean(U)=something

	/because z test z=x-u/(sigma/root(n))
	/here u want to take point estimate of u 
	/ so thats why u always want to pull mean=something into null hypo
