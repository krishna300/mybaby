# hacker rank i read 3 problems 


used all this for getting runner up score /last but one value

	set()
	sorted(key,reverse=True)
	sort()
	list()
	join()
	
sorted makes new list
sort doesn't make a new list
	


i also learnt how to read files/search 


Regularly used funcs :
map()
max()
split()
